A Fabric-based modpack built around optimizing your Minecraft client without adding extra bloat. 

### What is Paper Chan Optimized Plus?
This is a version of the modpack that includes extra mods. None of the extra mods included there improve performance, they're only QoL mods and improve the game's experience.

Unfortunately some mods we want to include cannot be included due to them only existing on CurseForge and not explicitly granting permission to redistribute.

### Performance
Paper Chan Optimized uses commonly installed Fabric performance mods to turn your client up to 11. Some of these mods include Sodium, Lithium, and Starlight.

### Vanilla Parity
Since we don't add any content mods the Paper Chan Optimized modpack will work in any world and on any server.

### Open source
We're a completely open source modpack. You can view our source code [here](https://github.com/mja00/paper-chan-optimized). Feel free to open issues or even make a PR to improve on the pack! 

## FAQ
- **Q:** Why did you create yet another optimization modpack?
    - **A:** We found it odd that other modpacks were including mods that really didn't need to be in an optimization modpack. We believe that the pack should be as bare bones as possible and only include what is needed. 
- **Q:** I ran into a bug! Where can I get it fixed?
   - **A:** Feel free to submit an issue on our GitHub [here](https://github.com/mja00/paper-chan-optimized). We'll look into what is causing the bug.
- **Q:** I enjoy what you're doing, how can I help out?
    - **A:** We appreciate that you're enjoying the modpack! Just using it is enough to help out but if you want to go above and beyond there are a few things that can be done!
        - Share the modpack with your friends! The more people who use it the more it'll be suggested.
        - [Disable your ad blocker on Modrinth!](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/details/ads/#browser-extensions) Modrinth kicks back some of the ad revenue to creators on the platform. 

## Versioning
We employ a somewhat normal versioning scheme. The current format is `w.x.y.z`.

`W` will increment each new major Minecraft release. For instance, version 1 is 1.19.X and 2 would be 1.20.X.  
`X` will increment with any changes to the list of mods. For instance, adding/removing a mod would increment that number.  
`Y` will increment with any updates to any mods in the list.  
`Z` will increment with any hotfixes to the modpack.  

## Mods we redistribute
Due to CurseForge's anti-competitive behavors we have to redistribute some mods. These are mods that currently are only available on Curse that we manually include in the pack.
- [Xaero's Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap)
  - Permission is granted to redistribute at the bottom of the mod's description in pink, 2nd bullet point. 
- [Xaero's Worldmap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map)
  - Same permissions as Xaero's Minimap

If you are an author of any of these mods and wish to have us remove it from the modpack either reach out to me on Discord at mja00#0001 or through email at [paper-chan@mart.fyi](mailto:paper-chan@mart.fyi)
